You need to have docker installed and running.

Open a bash inside the project folder (where the folders/files alembic, app, Dockerfile, requirements.txt, etc exist).

Type:

#docker ps -a (check that you have Docker installed and running, this is just for checking, its not a necessary step)

#docker compose up -d (starts the app, -d: after the installation is finished the program is running in the background. This stage takes the longest by far!
                       It can take up to 5-20 minutes to complete. Do not move on before it is finished)

#docker compose exec api bash (enter the app's bash to execute the migrations).

#alembic upgrade head (Run alembics migrations)

You can now close the bash, hopefully everything went well. You can make requests locally : http://127.0.0.1:8000..../.../... check out the End-points-Postman.txt.
